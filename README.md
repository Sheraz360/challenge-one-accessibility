# Challenge One - Accessibility

This project focuses on improving the accessibility of a website by implementing various best practices. The goal is to ensure that the website meets accessibility standards and provides an inclusive user experience for all users.

## Accessibility Improvements

To achieve accessibility standards, the following improvements were implemented:

- Semantic HTML elements were used throughout the source code, ensuring that the structure of the website is meaningful and understandable.
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, making it easier for assistive technologies and screen readers to interpret the content.
- Image and icon elements include descriptive `alt` attributes, providing alternative text for users who cannot see the images or for accessibility purposes.
- Heading attributes are used in a sequential order, following the hierarchical structure of the content and aiding in navigation.
- The title element contains a concise and descriptive title, accurately representing the purpose of the website.
